Simulation of SNeIa with Skysurvey in the ULTRASAT Survey

This is my Python script for deriving an estimated rate of observable SNeIa. It is not optimized for public use yet and one will probably run into some problems when it is used right away, even thought the important parts are there

Explaination: 
The ultrasat_simulation_*.py-files in the main folder are the runable scripts. The most important one is "_lightcurves.py" as it produces the lightcurves and puts them into the folder named "Lightcurve".
